The solution involves ensuring type consistency when updating the state.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state is a number

  const updateCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Update with a number - correct way
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Update Count" onPress={updateCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

If dealing with objects or arrays, ensure that the update maintains the expected structure.  Consider using spread syntax to update parts of the state object without changing its type:

```javascript
const [myObject, setMyObject] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

// Correct way to update:
setMyObject({ ...myObject, age: 31 });
```
By meticulously managing state updates and maintaining type consistency, you can prevent this type mismatch error from occurring.
