This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native and attempting to update the state with a value of a different type than its initial value.  For example, if the initial state is a number and you try to update it with a string, React Native might throw this error.  It can also occur with objects or arrays where the structure changes unexpectedly during updates.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state is a number

  const updateCount = () => {
    setCount('hello'); // Trying to update with a string - causes the error
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Update Count" onPress={updateCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
